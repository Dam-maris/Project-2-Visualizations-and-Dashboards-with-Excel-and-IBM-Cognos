# Project-2-Visualizations-and-Dashboards-with-Excel-and-IBM-Cognos
Visualizing car sales using Excel and IBM Cognos

## Part 1: Excel
created some visualizations to understand car sales and profits for each dealer.

Created visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics:

TASK 1: Quantity Sold by Dealer ID - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to Quantity Sold by Dealer ID (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet1, and use Format on the Chart tab to change the chart title)

TASK 2: Profit by Date and Model - as a line chart .Used the pivot table on Sheet2, and use Chart Title on the Chart tab to change the chart title)

TASK 3: Profit by Year and Dealer ID - as a column chart, titled Profit by Year and Dealer ID with the data columns in red (Hint: Used the pivot table on Sheet3, and use Format on the Chart tab to change the chart title and to format the series fill color in red)

TASK 4: Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID - as a line chart, titled Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID. Also remove the horizontal gridlines from the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green. (Hint: Used the pivot table on Sheet4, used Gridlines in the Axes group on the Chart tab to remove the gridlines, and use Format on the Chart tab to change the chart title, to move the legend, and to format the series outline color in green)

## Part 2: IBM Cognos
Created two dashboards as follows:

One dashboard using the tabbed template that has 4 small rectangles at the top and a large rectangle below (Sales dashboard).

One dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template (Service dashboard).

Captured the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
In the first small rectangle (Panel 1), captures Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
In the second small rectangle (Panel 2), captures Quantity sold
In the third small rectangle (Panel 3), capturess Quantity sold by model (as a bar chart)
In the fourth small rectangle (Panel 4), capture Average quantity sold

On the Sales dashboard in the large rectangle (Panel 5), displays Profit by Dealer ID as a column chart, sorted in ascending order.

On the Service dashboard, captures the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
Panel 1, capture the number of recalls per model of car (as a column chart)
Panel 2, capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews (as a treemap)
Panel 3, capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit (as a line and column chart).
Panel 4, capture the number of recalls by model and affected system (as a heat map). This will help us understand if there are any outliers for a given model or a specific system.
